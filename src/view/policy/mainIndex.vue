        2.3 Special Note about Children’s Information
      </h4>

      The services of LOCO are not for anyone under the age of 【18】, and anyone under the specified minimum age may not create a LOCO account or use LOCO services.

      <h4>
        3. How We Use the Information We Collect
      </h4>

      <h4>
        3.1 Purposes
      </h4>

      We may use your Information for any of the following purposes:

      1) to provide services to you (including both the services currently provided by us via LOCO and the services to be rendered by us via LOCO in the future);

      2) to personalize and improve our services and your experiences when you use our services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads;

      3) to respond to inquiries, for the purposes of customer service, security, archival and backup purposes in connection with providing services of LOCO;

      4) to monitor and analyze usage and trends of our services;

      5) to enhance the safety and security of our products and services;

      6) to verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity;

      7) to enforce our Terms of Use and other usage policies.

      LOCO allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the LOCO application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other LOCO users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the LOCO application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). LOCO is not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.

      <h4>
        3.2 Transfer and Storage
      </h4>

      We operate and may continue to operate servers in a number of jurisdictions around the world, so the server on which your personal information is used and stored may not be in your jurisdiction.

      You consent to the transfer of your personal information (both inside and outside of your jurisdiction) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

      <h4>
        3.3 Sharing
      </h4>

      Your information is shared with others in the following ways:

      Sharing on our products

      1) Public information in your profile can be seen by anyone. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.

      2) Your active status or usage information is collected and displayed to other users (e.g. whether you are currently active on LOCO).

      Sharing with third-party partners

      By using LOCO, you agree to the third party use, sharing, and transfer of your personal information (both inside and outside of your jurisdiction) as prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

      1) Measurement partners.

      We may share information about you in anonymous and/or aggregated form with third parties for usage analytics (to help us better understand who is using our services and how), and for industry analysis, research, and other similar purposes.

      2) Partners offering services in LOCO

      Your information may be accessed and used by our service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our services. These service providers may have access to your information but only to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose that information or use it for any other purposes. These providers will collect the information sent by your mobile phone, tablet or desktop computer, and their use of that information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.

      3) Law enforcement

      We may share information about you if we are (or if we believe we are) required by law or legal process (such as a subpoena, warrant or court order), if we have to respond to a lawful request from legal authorities to disclose such information, or if we need to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service or our other policies.

      4) New owner

      If we are acquired by a third party or may re-organise our group structure, your information may be transferred within our group and/or to a third party who will continue to operate LOCO or similar services under either this Privacy Policy or a different privacy policy which will be notified to you. The party to which your personal information is transferred may be located, and use your Information, outside of your jurisdiction.

      Other than as permitted under this Privacy Policy or as otherwise consented to by you or as required by law or legal process, we will not transfer your personal information to any other third parties for their processing for any purposes.

      <h4>
        3.4 Security Measures We Take to Protect Your Information
      </h4>

      We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, however, despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. In the event that your personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify you if your personal information has been compromised, as required by applicable law.

      Where we do share your personal information with any third parties, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that such third parties only use your personal information: (i) in compliance with this Privacy Policy; and (ii) subject to any other instructions we give them, including any appropriate confidentiality and security measures that we implement.

      <h4>
        4. How to Access Your Information
      </h4>

      You can access and modify the information you provided to us through your account.

      If you believe your information posted on LOCO is not authentic or accurate and can provide us with reasonable proof regarding this, you can require us via the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy to correct these unauthentic or inaccurate information and we will use reasonable efforts to honour your request; however, we may retain an archived copy of your information as required by law and/or for record keeping purposes.

      Once your account is closed or deleted, you will no longer have access to your message history, preferences or any other information associated with your use of our services. Even after you remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. Additionally, we will retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce the Terms of Service. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.

      In some cases, we may not be able to update, amend or remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know why we are unable to do so, for example, certain requests may require disproportionate technical effort or extremely impractical, or are prohibited by law.

      Since LOCO will be used in multiple jurisdictions and we may not be possible to identify all the inconsistency between certain terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable law in your jurisdiction, thus you agree to notify us once such inconsistency is identified by you. Under this circumstance we will take necessary methods to eliminate such inconsistency, including deleting these personal information improperly collected or used by us.
