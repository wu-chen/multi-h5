      <h4>LOCO – TERMS OF SERVICE</h4>
      <br><br>
      <h4>1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
      <br><br>
      Welcome to LOCO!
      <br><br>
      Your use of LOCO is subject to these Terms of Service (these "Terms"). Thank you for reviewing these Terms – we hope you enjoy using LOCO.
      <br><br>
      If you have any question about, or if you wish to send us any notice in relation to, these Terms, please contact us at locoloco8188@gmail.com.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.1 Compliance with these Terms</h4>
      <br><br>
      These Terms apply to you if you are a user of LOCO anywhere in the world.
      <br><br>
      Please review these Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot use LOCO. You must comply with these Terms in your use of LOCO and only use LOCO as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use this software.
      <br><br>
      If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use LOCO and must immediately terminate your use of this software and all services.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.2 Contracting Entity</h4>
      <br><br>
      By using LOCO, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms between you and LOCO Pro Labs ("we", "our" and "us").
      <br><br>
      We may specify in certain of our LOCO service-specific terms that you are contracting with one of our affiliate companies or Service Providers (instead of us) in relation to your use of the relevant LOCO service or feature to which the relevant service-specific terms apply. Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant LOCO service-specific terms, and these Terms (and those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant LOCO services or features.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.3 Service Eligibility</h4>
      <br><br>
      The services of LOCO are not for use by anyone under the age of 18.
      <br><br>
      To use the services, you agree that: (i) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; and (ii) you are not already restricted by us from using the services provided via LOCO.
      <br><br>
      We may change the Minimum Age from time to time based on our sole discretion. Where this is the case, the users of LOCO who were below the new Minimum Age when they started using the services under a previous Terms of Service may continue to use them, as they have already reached the new Minimum Age since then.
      <br><br>
      "Minimum Age" means 18 years old. However, if applicable law requires that you must be older in order to lawfully use LOCO without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.
      <br><br>
      If applicable law requires you to obtain the consent from your parent or guardian, then your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms (both for themselves and on your behalf) before you can use LOCO.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.4 Other general terms in relation to these Terms</h4>
      <br><br>
      We may translate these Terms into multiple languages, and in the event there is any difference between the English version and any other language version of these Terms, the English version will apply (to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations).
      <br><br>
      <h4>2. ADDITIONAL TERMS AND POLICIES</h4>
      <br><br>

These additional terms of service and policies all form part of and are incorporated into these Terms.

      <br><br>
      Where we consider that any changes to these Terms or LOCO are reasonably material, we will (where reasonably practicable) notify you of such changes by posting them on our website, through our services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective.

      <br><br>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to your account or any or all of LOCO: (i) if we reasonably believe that you have breached these Terms; (ii) if your use of LOCO creates risk for us or for other users of LOCO, gives rise to a threat of potential third party claims against us or is potentially damaging to our reputation; (iii) if you fail to use LOCO for a prolonged period; or (iv) for any other reason in our sole and absolute discretion.

If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the remaining terms of these Terms. No delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of any rights under that provision. Any rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive, including any obligations in relation to the liability of, or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect after termination or expiration of these Terms.
      <br><br>

      If you have any question about, or if you wish to send us any notice in relation to, these Terms, please contact us at veegocsteam@gmail.com.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.1 Compliance with these Terms</h4>
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      Please review these Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot use Veego. You must comply with these Terms in your use of Veego and only use Veego as permitted by applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use this software.
      <br><br>
      If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use Veego and must immediately terminate your use of this software and all services.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.2 Contracting Entity</h4>
      <br><br>
      By using Veego, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms between you and Veego Studio ("we", "our" and "us").
      <br><br>
      We may specify in certain of our Veego service-specific terms that you are contracting with one of our affiliate companies or Service Providers (instead of us) in relation to your use of the relevant Veego service or feature to which the relevant service-specific terms apply. Where this is the case, the relevant contracting entity will be identified in the relevant Veego service-specific terms, and these Terms (and those relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant Veego services or features.
      <br><br>
      <h4>1.3 Service Eligibility</h4>
      <br><br>

      To use the services, you agree that: (i) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; and (ii) you are not already restricted by us from using the services provided via Veego.
      <br><br>
      We may change the Minimum Age from time to time based on our sole discretion. Where this is the case, the users of Veego who were below the new Minimum Age when they started using the services under a previous Terms of Service may continue to use them, as they have already reached the new Minimum Age since then.
      <br><br>
      "Minimum Age" means 18 years old. However, if applicable law requires that you must be older in order to lawfully use Veego without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.

      <br><br>

      in using Your Content for these purposes, we and our affiliate companies may copy, reproduce, host, store, process, adapt, modify, translate, perform, distribute and publish Your Content worldwide by all distribution methods, including those that are developed in the future;

      we may share Your Content with third parties that we work with to help provide, promote, develop and improve Veego, but these third parties (other than our affiliate companies) will not make any separate use of Your Content for their own purposes (i.e. for any purposes that are not related to Veego);

      we may use the name that you submit in connection with Your Content (whether that be your account name, real name or otherwise); and
